# Generalized test targets configuration
# Mirrors production patterns without referencing specific customers
#
# Pattern: Multi-tier inheritance with source imports
#   - Staging targets import from sources (base layer)
#   - Production targets inherit from staging (inherit + extend)
#   - Demo targets inherit from production (full chain)

# Base staging target - imports directly from sources
Staging:
  imports:
    - analytics          # Primary analytics source
    - data-engineers     # Team-specific secrets

# Production target - inherits from staging
# All staging secrets + any prod-specific overrides
Production:
  - Staging

# Demo environment - inherits full production chain
Demo:
  - Production
